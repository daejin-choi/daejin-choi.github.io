The word-of-mouth diffusion has been regarded as an important mechanism to
advertise a new idea, image, technology, or
product in online social networks (OSNs). In this talk, I introduce the study on
the prediction of popular and viral image diffusion in Pinterest. We first
characterize an image cascade from two perspectives: (i) volume – how large the
cascade is, i.e., total number of users reached, and (ii) structural virality –
how many
users in the cascade are responsible for attracting other users.
Our model predicts whether an image will be (a) popular in
terms of the volume of its cascade, or (b) viral in terms of
the structural virality. Our analysis reveals that a popular image is not
necessarily viral, and vice versa. This motivates us
to investigate whether there are distinctive features for accurately predicting
popular or viral image cascades. To predict
the popular or viral image cascades, we consider the following feature sets: (i)
deep image features, (ii) image meta and
poster’s information, and (iii) initial propagation pattern. We
find that using deep image features alone is not as effective
in predicting popular or viral image cascades. We show that
image meta and poster’s information are strong predictors for
predicting popular image cascades while image meta and initial propagation
patterns are useful to predict viral image cascades. We believe our exploration
can give an important insight for content providers, OSN operators, and
marketers in predicting popular or viral image diffusion.

It becomes the norm for people to communicate with one another through various 
online social channels, where different conversation structures are formed 
depending on platforms. One of the common online communication patterns is a 
threaded conversation where a user brings up a conversation topic, and then 
other people respond to the initiator or other participants by commenting, 
which can be modeled as a tree structure. In this talk, I introduce the work
which investigates (i) the characteristics of online threaded conversations 
in terms of volume, responsiveness, and virality and (ii) what and how content 
properties and user participation behaviors are associated with such characteristics. 
To this end, we collect 700 K threaded conversations from 1.5 M users in Reddit, 
one of the most popular online communities allowing people to communicate with 
others in the form of threaded conversations. Using the collected dataset, we 
find that ‘social’ words, difficulties of texts, and document relevancy are 
associated with the volume, responsiveness, and virality of conversations. We 
also discover that large, viral conversations are mostly formed by a small 
portion of users who are reciprocally communicate with others by analyzing user 
interactions. Our analysis on discovering user roles in conversations reveal 
that users who are interested in multiple topics play important roles in large 
and viral conversations, whereas heavy posting users play important roles in 
responsive conversations. We expand our analysis to topical communities
(i.e., subreddits) and find that news-related, image-based,
and discussion-related communities are more likely to have
large, responsive, and viral conversations, respectively.
